# Force Login #

Force Login is a simple lightweight WordPress plugin that requires visitors to log in as a registered user to interact with the website. As simple as flipping a switch.

Make your website private until it's ready to share publicly, or keep it private for members only.

Here, you can browse the source of the [Force Login Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-force-login/) project, find and discuss open issues or contribute code to the plugin yourself.

Installation
------------

Here's a [guide on how to install the plugin in your WordPress site](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-force-login/installation/).
If you want to run the latest development version, you have two options:

* You can download the repository .zip file: [force-login.zip](https://github.com/kevinvess/wp-force-login/archive/master.zip)
* You can clone the GitHub repository using Git

This will download the latest development version of the Force Login plugin. While this version is usually stable,
it is not recommended for use in a production environment.
