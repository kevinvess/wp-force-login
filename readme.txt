Force Login is a simple lightweight plugin that requires visitors to log in to interact with the website.


== Description ==

Easily hide your WordPress site from public viewing by requiring visitors to log in first. As simple as flipping a switch.

Make your website private until it's ready to share publicly, or keep it private for members only.

**Features**

- WordPress Multisite compatible.
- Login redirects visitors back to the url they tried to visit.
- Extensive Developer API (hooks & filters).
- Customizable. Set a specific URL to always redirect to on login.
- Filter exceptions for certain pages or posts.
- Restrict REST API to authenticated users.
- Translation Ready & WPML certified.

**Bug Reports**

Bug reports for [Force Login are welcomed on GitHub](https://github.com/kevinvess/wp-force-login). Please note that GitHub is _not_ a support forum.


== Installation ==

Upload the Force Login plugin to your site, then Activate it.

1, 2: You're done!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. How can I specify a redirect URL on login? =

By default, the plugin sends visitors back to the URL they tried to access. However, you can redirect users to a specific URL by adding the built-in WordPress filter [login_redirect](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/login_redirect/) to your functions.php file.

= 2. How can I add exceptions for certain pages or posts? =

You can bypass Force Login based on any condition by adding the following filter to your functions.php file.

You may use the WordPress [Conditional Tags](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/references/list-of-conditional-tags/) in your code.

`
/**
 * Bypass Force Login to allow for exceptions.
 *
 * @param bool $bypass Whether to disable Force Login. Default false.
 * @param string $visited_url The visited URL.
 * @return bool
 */
function my_forcelogin_bypass( $bypass, $visited_url ) {

  // Allow 'My Page' to be publicly accessible
  if ( is_page('my-page') ) {
    $bypass = true;
  }

  return $bypass;
}
add_filter( 'v_forcelogin_bypass', 'my_forcelogin_bypass', 10, 2 );
`

Check out the [Force Login Wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/kevinvess/wp-force-login/wiki) for additional examples to allow URLs to be publicly accessible.

= 3. How do I hide the "← Back to {sitename}" link? =

The WordPress login screen includes a "← Back to {sitename}" link below the login form; which may not actually take you back to the site while Force Login is activated. You can hide this link by adding the following action to your functions.php file.

**Requires:** WordPress 2.5 or higher

`
// Hide the 'Back to {sitename}' link on the login screen.
function my_forcelogin_hide_backtoblog() {
  echo '<style type="text/css">#backtoblog{display:none;}</style>';
}
add_action( 'login_enqueue_scripts', 'my_forcelogin_hide_backtoblog' );
`
