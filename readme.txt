**Bug Reports**

Bug reports for [Force Login are welcomed on GitHub](https://github.com/kevinvess/wp-force-login). Please note that GitHub is _not_ a support forum.


== Installation ==

Upload the Force Login plugin to your site, then Activate it.

1, 2: You're done!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. How can I specify a URL to redirect to on login? =

By default, the plugin sends visitors back to the URL they tried to visit. However, you can set a specific URL to always redirect users to by adding the following filter to your functions.php file.

The URL must be absolute (as in, <http://example.com/mypage/>). Recommended: [site_url( '/mypage/' )](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/site_url).

`
/**
 * Set the URL to redirect to on login.
 *
 * @return string URL to redirect to on login. Must be absolute.
 */
function my_forcelogin_redirect() {
  return site_url( '/mypage/' );
}
add_filter('v_forcelogin_redirect', 'my_forcelogin_redirect', 10, 1);
`

= 2. How can I add exceptions for certain pages or posts? =

You can bypass Force Login based on any condition or specify an array of URLs to whitelist by adding either of the following filters to your functions.php file. You may also use the WordPress [Conditional Tags](http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags).

**Bypass Force Login**

`
/**
 * Bypass Force Login to allow for exceptions.
 *
 * @return bool Whether to disable Force Login. Default false.
 */
function my_forcelogin_bypass( $bypass ) {
  if ( is_single() ) {
    $bypass = true;
  }
  return $bypass;
}
add_filter('v_forcelogin_bypass', 'my_forcelogin_bypass', 10, 1);
`

**Whitelist URLs**

Each URL must be absolute (as in, <http://example.com/mypage/>). Recommended: [site_url( '/mypage/' )](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/site_url).

`
/**
 * Filter Force Login to allow exceptions for specific URLs.
 *
 * @return array An array of URLs. Must be absolute.
 */
function my_forcelogin_whitelist( $whitelist ) {
  $whitelist[] = site_url( '/mypage/' );
  $whitelist[] = site_url( '/2015/03/post-title/' );
  return $whitelist;
}
add_filter('v_forcelogin_whitelist', 'my_forcelogin_whitelist', 10, 1);
`

**Whitelist ID**

Each ID must be INT

`
/**
 * Filter Force Login to allow exceptions for specific ID.
 *
 * @return array An array of ID.
 */
function v_forcelogin_whitelistID( $whitelistID ) {
	// list of page ID
	$whitelistID[] = 63;
  
	return $whitelistID;
  }
  add_filter('v_forcelogin_whitelistID', 'v_forcelogin_whitelistID', 10, 1);
`


= 3. How can I add exceptions for dynamic URLs? =

Some URLs have unique query strings appended to the end of it, which is composed of a series of parameter-value pairs.

For example:
<http://example.com/mypage/?parameter=value>

Checkout the [Force Login Wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/kevinvess/wp-force-login/wiki/Whitelist-Dynamic-URLs) for examples of the different methods for whitelisting dynamic URLs.

= 4. How do I get the WordPress mobile app to work? =

By default, the plugin blocks access to all page URLs; you may need to whitelist the XML-RPC page to allow the WordPress app to access your site for remote publishing.

`
/**
 * Filter Force Login to allow exceptions for specific URLs.
 *
 * @return array An array of URLs. Must be absolute.
 */
function my_forcelogin_whitelist( $whitelist ) {
  $whitelist[] = site_url( '/xmlrpc.php' );
  return $whitelist;
}
add_filter('v_forcelogin_whitelist', 'my_forcelogin_whitelist', 10, 1);
`

= 5. How do I hide the "← Back to {sitename}" link on the login screen? =

The WordPress login screen includes a "← Back to {sitename}" link below the login form; which may not actually take you back to the site while Force Login is activated. You can hide this link by adding the following action to your functions.php file.

**Requires:** WordPress 2.5 or higher

`
// Hide the 'Back to {sitename}' link on the login screen.
function my_forcelogin_hide_backtoblog() {
  echo '<style type="text/css">#backtoblog{display:none;}</style>';
}
add_action('login_enqueue_scripts', 'my_forcelogin_hide_backtoblog');
`
